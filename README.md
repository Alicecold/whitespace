# Whitespace

* ws2c.c  
  This is a compiler and interpreter of the Whitespace language. Both the interpreter and the compiler use the 
  same execution engine (in ws_engine.h)
* wsc.sh  
  A small script to compile and run the C version.
* gen-*.c  
  These C program use the ws_gencode.h header to generate Whitespace code; I only wrote the deadfish one.  
  Note that the language variant is very close to that generated by ws2c.c when it creates C code. 
* wsa*.*   
  A couple of "quick hacks" to convert the input for other Whitespace assemblers for ws_gencode.h.
* tests  
  A small collection of test files.
